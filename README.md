CSS Flexbox: Creating a Responsive Grid Layout with CSS Flexbox

In this project, I used CSS Flexbox to create a responsive grid layout for an e-commerce website. The grid layout will include multiple rows and columns of products (electronics, shows, clothes, etc.), with the ability to reorganize the layout on different screen sizes using media queries. Use media queries to adjust the layout of the grid for different screen sizes.
