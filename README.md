CSS Flexbox: Creating a Responsive Grid Layout with CSS Flexbox

In this project, I used CSS Flexbox to create a responsive grid layout for an e-commerce website. The grid layout will includes 5 rows and 5 columns of products (clothes), with the ability to reorganize the layout on different screen sizes using media queries.

It is a responsive HTML & CSS website.
